- The end goal of th Modeling stage is that the data model answers the business question
- The data modeling process users a training data set. Data scientists test multiple algorithms on the training set data to determine whether the variables are required and whether the data supports answering the business question. The outcome of those models are either descriptive or predictive.

# Modeling to Evaluation
## Unveil the Modeling Process and Assess Performance

**Modeling and evaluation play a pivotal role in shaping analytical outcomes and refining problem-solving strategies**
1. Data modeling, aims to determine the characteristics and purpose of the modeling process. Models can be descriptive / predictive. They are based on statistical or machine learning approaches.
2. Training set and calibratin, training set serves as a gauge to calibrate the model. Experiment with algorithms for variable selection is done. Success depends on problem understanding and analytical approach.
3. Model evaluation, Model evaluation is iterative, done alongside model building. It occurs before deployment, assessing model quality and alignment with the intial request.
4. Diagnostic measures, diagnostic measures ensure intended model functionality. Significance testing interprets data. ROC curve aids optimal classification selection by quantifying performance
